# **User Engagement Analysis**

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Yelp dataset for user engagement using data-driven methods. The goal is to extract actionable insights, visualize trends, and interpret the factors driving user behavior. The analysis utilizes Python and popular libraries such as SQLlite, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Key Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Overview of the dataset: Shape, structure, and basic statistics.
   - Handling missing values and preprocessing.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Distribution analysis of key variables.
   - Relationships between features and target variables.
   - Identification of trends and patterns through visualizations.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visual representation of user activity trends.
   - Comparative analysis using bar plots, histograms, and line charts.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Derived actionable insights based on data trends.
   - Provided recommendations for improving user engagement.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQLlite, Folium Maps, SQL
- Jupyter Notebook

## Summary of Insights
- Users show higher engagement on specific days of the week, suggesting strategic timing for campaigns.
- Certain demographic groups or user segments drive higher activity levels.
- Key features strongly correlated with engagement were identified.
