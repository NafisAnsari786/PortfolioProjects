## Key Insights:
 
- **Credit History**: Applicants with no or poor credit history tend to have a higher likelihood of defaulting on loans. This suggests that financial institutions should consider enforcing a minimum credit score or history requirement before approving loans.

- **Loan Amount vs. Income**: Larger loan amounts are associated with higher default risk, especially for applicants with lower income. Therefore, lending institutions could introduce stricter limits on loan amounts for low-income applicants to mitigate default risks.

- **Income Levels**: Applicants with lower or highly variable income show a higher risk of default. Financial institutions could consider offering loan products tailored to people with unstable income, potentially with lower loan amounts and longer repayment periods.

- **Employment Status**: Applicants with longer employment durations tend to be more reliable in repaying loans. The employment type and stability of the applicant should be a key consideration in the approval process.

## Business Recommendations:

- **Credit History Requirement**: Consider implementing a threshold for credit history (e.g., a minimum number of years or credit score) for loan approvals. Applicants with no credit history or low scores should be flagged as high risk.

- **Loan Amount Restrictions**: Based on the findings, loans should be limited for applicants with lower income. For high-risk applicants, consider offering smaller loan amounts or higher interest rates to offset the risk.

- **Targeted Loan Offerings**: Offer loan products designed for high-risk applicants but with modified terms. These products could include smaller loan amounts, higher interest rates, or longer repayment periods to reduce the financial strain and mitigate default risks.

- **Employment Verification**: Ensure that applicants with unstable employment or short job tenures are either rejected or offered loans with stricter terms (e.g., higher interest rates or smaller amounts).

## Example Insights and Recommendations:

- **Finding**: Applicants without a credit history are more likely to default.  
  **Recommendation**: Set a minimum credit score threshold to qualify for a loan.

- **Finding**: Higher loan amounts tend to correlate with a higher likelihood of default, especially for low-income applicants.  
  **Recommendation**: Consider introducing loan caps based on income level or a more thorough assessment of an applicantâ€™s ability to repay large loans.

- **Finding**: Applicants with lower or highly variable income are at higher risk of default.  
  **Recommendation**: Develop loan products that are better suited to this group, such as smaller loans with flexible repayment plans.
