## Project Overview
The project analyzes bike rides in London between **2015** and **2017**. It includes:
- Total bike rides over the selected time period.
- The moving average of bike rides.
- A comparison of temperature and wind speed with bike ride counts.

The insights generated will help better understand how environmental conditions influence biking activity.

---

## Data
The dataset includes:
1. **Total Bike Rides**: Aggregated counts of bike rides.
2. **Temperature**: Measured in degrees Celsius (C).
3. **Wind Speed**: Measured in kilometers per hour (kph).
4. **Time Series**: Daily counts of bike rides.

### Time Period:
- Start: **2015**
- End: **2017**

---

## Key Visualizations
### 1. Total Bike Rides
- **Total Rides**: **8,804,436** shows the rides within a specific time period.

### 2. Moving Average Duration
- The **Moving Average Duration** highlights the overall trend in bike usage.
- Peak usage occurs during warmer months and declines during colder months.

### 3. Temperature vs Wind Speed
- The table visualizes how the number of bike rides changes with varying temperature and wind speed.
- Rows: Temperature levels (0°C to 32.4°C).
- Columns: Wind speed ranges (0 kph to 53.6 kph).
- Darker cells indicate higher bike ride counts.

---

## Insights
1. **Total Bike Usage**
   - Over 19 million bike rides were recorded during the analyzed period.

2. **Trends**
   - The Moving Average Duration shows higher bike usage in summer months (June to September).
   - Winter months (December) saw a significant decline in rides.

3. **Impact of Weather**
   - **Temperature**: Higher temperatures (10°C to 22°C) correspond to peak bike rides.
   - **Wind Speed**: Bike rides decrease as wind speed increases, particularly above **28.6 kph**.
   - Example: At 10°C, there are significantly fewer rides at wind speeds above **32.1 kph**.

4. **Extreme Weather**
   - At extreme temperatures (0°C or 32°C), biking activity drops noticeably.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/london-bike-rides-analysis.git
   cd london-bike-rides-analysis
   ```
2. Access the dashboard or visualization outputs.
3. Analyze trends and patterns to gain insights.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau

- **Dashboarding**: Tableau (for interactive charts)

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the influence of weather conditions on biking activity in London. By analyzing temperature, wind speed, and trends over time, stakeholders can better predict bike usage and plan infrastructure or biking services accordingly.

---

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time weather data to predict bike usage.
- Expand analysis to other cities for comparison.
