# E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard Project

## **Project Overview**
This project involves building an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard for an e-commerce dataset. The dashboard helps visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and provides actionable insights into revenue, profit, and order metrics across various dimensions such as countries, markets, subcategories, and e-commerce platforms.

---

## **Dataset Details**
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Segment**: Customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- **Country**: Country where the order was placed.
- **Market**: Market region (e.g., Asia Pacific, Europe).
- **E-commerce Site**: Platform where the order was placed (e.g., Snapdeal, Flipkart, Amazon).
- **Order Priority**: Priority of the order (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Sub-Category**: Product sub-category (e.g., Labels, Binders).
- **Sales**: Revenue generated by the order.
- **Profit**: Profit earned on the order.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of items sold.
- **Order Date**: Date of the order.

## **Power BI Development Process**
### **1. Data Preparation:**
- Imported the dataset into Power BI.
- Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query.
- Created calculated columns and measures for key metrics (e.g., Total Revenue, Total Profit, Profit Ratio).

### **2. Calculated Measures:**
#### Total Revenue:
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(Sales)
```
#### Total Profit:
```DAX
Total Profit = SUM(Profit)
```
#### Profit Ratio:
```DAX
Profit Ratio = DIVIDE(SUM(Profit), SUM(Sales), 0) * 100
```
#### Revenue Growth Per Year:
```DAX
Revenue Growth = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Revenue],
        YEAR(OrderDate) = EARLIER(YEAR(OrderDate))
    )
```

### **3. Dashboard Creation:**
- Used appropriate visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and tables.
- Applied slicers for dynamic filtering by **Segment**.
- Standardized color schemes for a professional appearance.

## **Key Features of the Dashboard**
1. **Interactive Filters**:
   - Segment-wise filtering enables dynamic insights.
2. **Visualizations**:
   - Multiple visual types for clarity and engagement.
3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Highlights both top-performing and underperforming areas.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Additional dimensions like Order Date or Customer Demographics can be incorporated.
